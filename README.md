# simplified-weather-calendar
A simplified calendar design for monitoring rainfall, temperature, rain days, and atmospheric pressure in dark mode
![a preview of the app. It contains a three by four table of rectangles with a gradient of topaz, emerald green, and turquoise](https://github.com/shannaurelle/simplified-weather-calendar/blob/eb7790ce506010f147174cdb707d8aa5a533fec8/preview.PNG)

For this calendar, it is aimed to be responsive following a mobile first design. Bright months correspond to great magnitude of the positive variables involved, while faded months are months
which are detrimental to the task at hand. For this example, this is geared towards an agricultural use case, so the brightest months are the best months to sow new seedlings and grow them.
Months which are lightly faded or faded are best reserved for continuation of growth and harvest. Meanwhile, the percentage of the colors present in a rectangle gradient color is the weighted
intensity of the factor. 
## Getting Started

## Roadmap 
For this calendar we aim to start with a flat design, then slowly add more interactive and intuitive features.
1. Add an animation of colors swirling the rectangle when hovered
2. Add button functionality for the button and its relevant animations
3. Add specific daily rectangles for each month
4. Add a light mode for this design and let user decide when to switch
